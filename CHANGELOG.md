# Changelog

All notable changes to bicameral-mcp are tracked here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## 0.4.10 — 2026-04-14 — Guided Mode (Always-On Hints)

Reframes v0.4.9's tester mode. **`action_hints` now fire whenever
findings exist, regardless of mode.** The flag controls **intensity**,
not existence. Also adds setup-wizard configuration so the choice is
durable across sessions.

### Renamed

- `tester_mode` → **`guided_mode`** everywhere (context field, env
  var, skill name, tests, docstrings). Reads better, matches the
  user-facing language ("guide me through this codebase").
- `BICAMERAL_TESTER_MODE` → **`BICAMERAL_GUIDED_MODE`** env var.
- `bicameral-tester` skill → **`bicameral-guided`** skill.
- `tests/test_v049_tester_mode.py` → `tests/test_v0410_guided_mode.py`.

### Changed — semantic shift

- **Hints are always-on.** Pre-v0.4.10, `action_hints` was empty
  unless tester mode was enabled. Now it's populated whenever the
  response contains findings — drifted decisions, ungrounded matches,
  divergent pairs, open questions. The `guided_mode` flag controls:
  - **`blocking: bool`** — `True` in guided mode (skill contract
    forbids writes), `False` in normal mode (advisory only).
  - **`message` tone** — imperative ("review BEFORE making changes")
    in guided mode, advisory ("heads up — N decision(s) look
    drifted") in normal mode. Two distinct message variants per hint
    kind so the user can tell at a glance.
- **Normal mode is no longer silent.** A regular search query that
  returns a drifted decision now surfaces a non-blocking hint. The
  agent should mention it to the user (one line is enough) and
  continue. This makes bicameral consistently push signal at the
  user, with intensity dialed by their setup choice.

### Added

- **Setup wizard prompt** — `bicameral setup` now asks:
  ```
    Interaction intensity:
      1. Normal  — bicameral flags discrepancies as advisory hints (default)
      2. Guided  — bicameral stops you when it detects discrepancies
    Choice [1/2]:
  ```
  The choice is written to `.bicameral/config.yaml` as `guided: true`
  or `guided: false`. Edit the file directly to change later.
- **Config file resolution.** `BicameralContext.from_env()` reads
  `.bicameral/config.yaml` for the durable `guided` flag.
  `BICAMERAL_GUIDED_MODE` env var (truthy: `1 / true / yes / on`,
  falsy: `0 / false / no / off`) is a one-off override that wins
  over the file. Unset → fall back to the file → fall back to
  `false`.
- **`bicameral-guided` SKILL.md** — full contract for both intensity
  modes. Replaces the v0.4.9 `bicameral-tester` skill.

### Migration

No schema changes. Existing v0.4.9 installs:

- `BICAMERAL_TESTER_MODE` env var no longer recognized — set
  `BICAMERAL_GUIDED_MODE` instead. (Same truthy/falsy semantics.)
- `.bicameral/config.yaml` files without a `guided:` field default to
  `false` (normal mode). Re-run `bicameral setup` to be prompted, or
  add `guided: true` / `guided: false` manually.
- Pre-v0.4.10 callers that ignored `action_hints` are unaffected —
  the field is still optional and still populates a list, just one
  that's no longer always empty.

## 0.4.9 — 2026-04-14 — Tester Mode + Search Status Fix

Phase 2 of v0.4.8. Adds an opt-in **tester mode** that makes
`bicameral.search` and `bicameral.brief` responses emit **blocking
action hints** the agent must address before any write operation.
Hints surface drifted decisions, ungrounded decisions, divergent
decision pairs, and unresolved open questions linked to the query
scope. For onboarding, demos, and skill evaluation flows where you
want bicameral to push signal at the agent instead of waiting for
the agent to ask.

### Added

- **`BicameralContext.tester_mode: bool`** — parsed from
  `BICAMERAL_TESTER_MODE` env var at context construction. Accepts
  `1 / true / yes / on` (case-insensitive). Off by default.
- **`ActionHint`** — Pydantic model in `contracts.py`. Four kinds:
  - `review_drift` — drifted decisions in the match set
  - `ground_decision` — ungrounded decisions in the match set
  - `resolve_divergence` — two non-superseded decisions contradict on
    the same symbol (brief only)
  - `answer_open_questions` — open-question-shaped gaps in scope
    (brief only)
  Each hint has `kind`, `message`, `blocking: bool`, and `refs`.
- **`SearchDecisionsResponse.action_hints` + `BriefResponse.action_hints`**
  — optional list fields. Empty when `tester_mode=False`, so regular
  mode is byte-identical to v0.4.8 except for the new empty field.
- **`handlers/action_hints.py`** — pure post-compute hint generators.
  Zero extra DB roundtrips; inspect already-computed response objects
  and emit hints derived from their contents.
- **`bicameral-tester` skill** — new top-level skill doc explaining
  when to enable tester mode, what the blocking contract is, how to
  debug hints that don't fire.
- **`bicameral-search` + `bicameral-brief` SKILL.md** — new "Tester
  Mode Contract" sections teaching the agent to address blocking hints
  before any write.

### Fixed

- **Pre-existing search status bug** — `handle_search_decisions` was
  reading `status` from `raw_regions[0]` but `code_region` rows don't
  carry a status field (it's on the intent node). Every search match
  had been silently reported as `pending` regardless of real state,
  masking drifted decisions from callers. Now reads intent-level
  `status` from the `search_by_bm25` row, which already selects it.
  This is load-bearing for Phase 2: without the fix, the
  `review_drift` hint generator couldn't fire because no match ever
  looked drifted to it. Surfaced during the Accountable drift demo
  walkthrough (see `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-04-14-accountable-drift-demo.md`).

### Migration

No schema changes. `action_hints` is an optional list defaulting to
`[]`, so v0.4.8 clients ignore it. Tester mode is off by default —
existing deployments are byte-identical in non-tester mode. The search
status bug fix is backward-compatible: reflected / drifted decisions
that were silently misreported as pending now show the correct status.
This may change downstream UI grouping ("why is this now drifted?") —
the answer is it was ALWAYS drifted, v0.4.9 just stopped hiding it.

## 0.4.8 — 2026-04-14 — Ingest → Brief Auto-Chain

`bicameral.ingest` now automatically fires `bicameral.brief` on a topic
derived from the payload and returns the brief embedded in
`IngestResponse.brief`. Callers get divergence detection, drift signal, gap
extraction, and suggested meeting questions in the same round-trip that
produced the new decisions — no second tool call required. The killer
feature: fresh-ingest contradiction alerts. If the new ingest adds a
decision that conflicts with an existing one on the same symbol, the
chained brief surfaces the divergence at the moment of creation instead
of silently.

### Added

- **`IngestResponse.brief: BriefResponse | None`** — fused response field.
  Populated when the payload has a derivable topic; `None` when it
  doesn't (payload with only action_items, empty title, empty query).
- **`_derive_brief_topic(payload)`** — picks topic via priority chain:
  `payload.query` → longest raw decision description → `payload.title`
  → empty. Reads raw `payload["decisions"][...]` to avoid the
  `[Action:]` / `[Open Question]` prefixes that `_normalize_payload`
  injects into `mapping.intent`. Word-boundary truncation at 200 chars.
- **Within-call sync dedup guard** (`handlers/link_commit.py`) —
  `_sync_cache_lookup` / `_store_sync_cache` / `invalidate_sync_cache`
  short-circuit back-to-back `handle_link_commit("HEAD")` calls within
  the same MCP invocation so auto-chains don't do N× backfill + drift
  sweeps. Caches the **full** `LinkCommitResponse` so downstream
  `sync_status` consumers see real `regions_updated` numbers, not
  synthetic zeros. Re-reads live HEAD via `git rev-parse` on every
  lookup so a mid-call commit bypasses the stale cache.
- **`bicameral-ingest` skill step 5** — teaches the agent to present
  `IngestResponse.brief` following the bicameral-brief presentation
  rules (divergences first, drift candidates, decisions, gaps,
  suggested_questions verbatim).

### Fixed

- **Pre-existing `bicameral.brief` double-sync** — `handle_brief` was
  calling `link_commit(HEAD)` twice per invocation in v0.4.6 / v0.4.7
  (once directly, once via its chained `handle_search_decisions`). The
  v0.4.8 dedup guard collapses this to one sync. Brief gets faster on
  every call, not just auto-chained ones.

### Migration

No schema changes. `IngestResponse.brief` is optional, so v0.4.7 clients
ignore it. The sync dedup is transparent — callers can't tell a dedup
hit from the original call except by the normalized
`reason="already_synced"` string (which matches the ledger's own
idempotency wording).

## 0.4.7 — 2026-04-14 — FC-3 Vocab Cache Similarity Gate

Fixes witnessed cross-contamination where the vocab cache reused an unrelated
intent's code regions — and, worse, labeled them with the original intent's
`purpose` text. Observed live on Accountable 2026-04-14: a "Stripe payment-link
fallback" decision inherited 8 bogus regions from an earlier "weekly bulletin
page" ingest because both descriptions shared incidental tokens.

### Fixed

- **FC-3a — Vocab cache BM25 cross-match.** `lookup_vocab_cache` now returns
  `(symbols, matched_query_text)`. `handle_ingest` computes Jaccard similarity
  over non-stopword 4+ char tokens and discards hits below 0.5, forcing a
  fall-through to fresh grounding via `ground_mappings`. Deterministic, no LLM
  in the critical indexing path (per `git-for-specs.md`).
- **FC-3b — Stale `purpose` field on reused regions.** `_validate_cached_regions`
  now accepts `current_description` and rewrites every returned region's
  `purpose` field so reused regions carry the *current* intent's text, not the
  cached one's.

### Migration

No manual action required. `v0.4.6 → v0.4.7` is a handler-layer fix. Existing
vocab_cache rows remain valid; the gate rejects false positives on read.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-04-14 — Adoption Floor (Trust + First Wow)

Five initiatives: FC-1 BM25 degeneracy guard, FC-2 multi-region grounding
via graph-channel fusion, authoritative-ref + pollution guards at both write
sites, `bicameral.brief` pre-meeting one-pager, and `bicameral.reset` fail-safe
valve.

### Added

- **`bicameral.brief(topic, participants?)`** — Pre-meeting one-pager generator.
  Returns decisions in scope, drift candidates, gaps, and divergences (Branch
  Problem Instance 4: non-superseded contradictory decisions on the same
  symbol). 3-5 suggested meeting questions. Heuristic-only in v0.4.6, no LLM.
  Skill at `skills/bicameral-brief/SKILL.md` enforces "divergences surface
  BEFORE decisions" rule.
- **`bicameral.reset(confirm=false)`** — Nuke-and-replay recovery path for a
  polluted ledger. Dry run by default, returns replay plan from
  `source_cursor` rows. `confirm=true` wipes every bicameral row scoped to
  the current repo via graph traversal (multi-repo isolation preserved).
  Skill at `skills/bicameral-reset/SKILL.md` enforces two-call dry-run pattern.
- **FC-2 multi-region grounding** — `_ground_single` in
  `adapters/code_locator.py` seeds the graph channel in
  `search_code(query, symbol_ids=...)` with fuzzy-validated symbol IDs,
  activating the RRF fusion layer (`code_locator/fusion/rrf.py`) that was
  previously built but unwired. Multi-file features (React component + hook
  + supabase function + migration) now ground to multiple real implementation
  files instead of collapsing to a single BM25 tiebreak winner. Pure wiring
  fix — no new infrastructure.

### Fixed

- **FC-1 BM25 degeneracy guard** — `RealCodeLocatorAdapter.ground_mappings`
  refuses to ground descriptions whose tokens reduce to fewer than 2 entries
  in the corpus vocabulary. Closes the spurious-anchor path where
  open-question intents ("GitHub Discussions vs Slack") collapsed to the
  densest-term-frequency file. New `Bm25sClient.count_corpus_tokens()` helper.
- **Silent branch pollution — Bug 1 (F1, `link_commit` write site)** —
  `ingest_commit` refuses baseline writes when the current branch name
  (via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`) doesn't match the authoritative
  ref. Drift is reported in memory but stored hashes, sync cursor, and intent
  status are not mutated. Branch-name comparison survives normal commits
  advancing main.
- **Silent branch pollution — Bug 3 (F1a, `ingest_payload` write site)** —
  `ingest_payload` now stamps baseline hashes against `ctx.authoritative_sha`
  instead of current HEAD. Fixes the day-1 poisoning vector where ingesting
  from a feature branch birthed a polluted ledger on a fresh install. A
  warning log line fires at ingest time when the user is on a non-authoritative
  ref.
- **Authoritative-ref auto-detection** — New helpers `detect_authoritative_ref`
  and `resolve_ref_sha` in `code_locator_runtime.py`. Resolution order:
  `BICAMERAL_AUTHORITATIVE_REF` env var → `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
  → fallback `"main"`. Stored on `BicameralContext` as `authoritative_ref` +
  `authoritative_sha` fields.

### Added — tests (+49 cases)

- `tests/test_fc1_bm25_degeneracy.py` — 11 cases: helper unit tests,
  5 fixture-driven degenerate queries, ground_mappings integration
- `tests/test_fc2_multi_region_grounding.py` — 4 cases: graph channel
  activation, multi-file emission, `max_symbols` cap, BM25-only fallback
- `tests/test_phase2_brief.py` — 17 cases: conflict heuristics, divergence
  detector, gap extractor, question generator, end-to-end with seeded ledger
- `tests/test_reset.py` — 4 cases: dry-run plan, actual wipe, multi-repo
  isolation, replay plan fidelity
- `tests/test_authoritative_ref.py` — 5 cases: env override, origin/HEAD
  detection, main fallback, resolve_ref_sha happy + missing
- `tests/test_pollution_bug.py` — 2 end-to-end cases with branched tmp git
  repo: ingest on branch stamps main-anchored hashes, link_commit on
  branch leaves stored baselines untouched

### Migration

No manual action required. `v0.4.5 → v0.4.6` is a handler + skill layer
release. No schema changes.

- Users on multi-branch workflows: set `BICAMERAL_AUTHORITATIVE_REF=<branch>`
  to override detection if `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
  doesn't return the expected branch (shallow clones, single-branch repos).
- Users whose v0.4.5 ledger got polluted by ingesting from a feature branch:
  run `bicameral.reset confirm=true` to wipe and replay from scratch.

### Known issues — will be fixed in v0.4.7

- **FC-3: Vocab cache cross-contamination + stale purpose field.** The
  vocab cache uses SurrealDB's `@0@` BM25 operator to match incoming
  descriptions against stored `query_text`, then reuses the cached symbols
  array without a similarity threshold. Two unrelated intents sharing
  incidental tokens can cross-match, and `_validate_cached_regions`
  preserves the cached region's `purpose` field (= the original intent's
  description), cross-wiring intents visually. Witnessed 2026-04-14 on
  Accountable: a Stripe payment-link fallback decision inherited 8 bogus
  regions from an earlier weekly-bulletin ingest. **Workaround:**
  `bicameral.reset confirm=true` clears vocab cache and re-ingest fresh.
  Fix planned for v0.4.7 — similarity gate on cache reuse + `purpose`
  field rewrite on hit.

### Rollback

Each feature is independently revertable via env var:
- `BICAMERAL_AUTHORITATIVE_REF=` (empty) → pollution guard disabled
- Removing `skills/bicameral-brief/` → brief skill unloaded

## 0.4.5 — 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Ingest now stamps a baseline `content_hash` at HEAD for every grounded
  region.** Previously `ingest_payload` only computed a hash when the caller
  explicitly passed `commit_hash` in the payload, which the MCP `bicameral_ingest`
  handler never did — so every bulk transcript ingest persisted empty hashes
  and decisions were permanently stuck in `pending`. Now `ingest_payload`
  resolves HEAD from `repo_path` when no commit_hash is supplied, computes a
  baseline hash for every region, and derives the intent's initial status from
  that hash. Freshly ingested decisions are born `reflected` when their
  grounded code exists at HEAD.
- **Empty-hash regions from older ledgers are now self-healed.** `handle_link_commit`
  runs a repo-scoped backfill sweep before the normal drift loop, walking any
  code regions with an empty `content_hash` and handing them to
  `HashDriftAnalyzer`, which adopts the current git state as the baseline and
  flips the owning intents to `reflected`. No forced migration, no new tooling —
  just call `bicameral_status` or any other handler that triggers a
  `link_commit` and legacy ledgers heal themselves.
- **`HashDriftAnalyzer.analyze_region` self-heals missing baselines.** When
  `stored_hash == ""` and the analyzer can compute a real hash at the requested
  ref, it returns `reflected` with the new hash as the baseline instead of the
  old `ungrounded` verdict. Used by both the new backfill path and the regular
  drift sweep.

### Added

- Per-region status aggregation on intents: an intent with multiple code
  regions now adopts the loudest status across them (drifted > reflected >
  pending > ungrounded), so a single drifted region always raises an alarm
  even if other regions still reflect.
- `SurrealDBLedgerAdapter.backfill_empty_hashes(repo_path, drift_analyzer=...)`
  — public method to run the backfill sweep on demand. Idempotent and scoped
  by repo, so multi-repo SurrealDB instances stay isolated.
- `ledger.queries.get_regions_without_hash(client, repo="")` — helper query
  used by the backfill sweep to find legacy regions.
- New test module `tests/test_phase1_l1_wiring.py` with four regression
  scenarios: ingest→reflected, edit→drifted, phantom range→not reflected,
  and legacy empty-hash backfill→reflected.

### Migration

No manual action required. Existing ledgers backfill themselves on the next
`bicameral_status`, `bicameral_link_commit`, or any other tool that drives a
`link_commit`. Users whose files aren't touched by subsequent commits can
also simply re-run their original bulk ingest — v0.4.5 stamps hashes at ingest
time, so re-ingestion produces correct status for every grounded decision
without any further work.
