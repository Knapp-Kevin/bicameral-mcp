# Symbol-Level BM25: Fixing the Retrieval Granularity Problem

**Date**: 2026-04-19
**Status**: Planned
**Author**: Silong

## Problem

Recall is stuck at 30% despite MRR@3 reaching 0.79. Incremental tuning
(fuzzy scorers, abbreviation dictionaries, BM25 params) yields <2pp gains.

Root cause: **the unit of retrieval is wrong**. BM25 indexes files, but
the eval measures symbol-level accuracy. The pipeline finds the right
files then fails to pick the right symbols from them.

```
"payment provider authorize calls"
  → BM25 finds payment.ts           (correct file)
  → Stage 2 picks: Payment, Provider (wrong symbols)
  → Expected: PaymentProviderService (never selected)
  → Recall: 0
```

This pattern accounts for 60%+ of recall failures. The two-stage
file→symbol resolution in `_ground_single()` is architecturally unable
to solve it — BM25 has no signal about which SYMBOL within a file is
relevant, only which FILE matches the query.

## Solution: Symbol-Level BM25 Index

Index one BM25 document per **symbol** instead of per file. The query
"payment provider authorize calls" directly matches the document for
`PaymentProviderService` because its document text contains
`PaymentProviderService payment provider service`.

### Current vs Proposed Architecture

```
CURRENT (file-level):
  description → tokens → fuzzy match → graph seeds
                                      ↓
                       BM25(files) → pick symbols from files → return
                       ~500 docs      130 lines of Stage 2 logic

PROPOSED (symbol-level):
  description → BM25(symbols) → return top-K symbols directly
                ~2500 docs      Stage 2 eliminated
                              ↓
                + graph channel fusion for multi-file coverage
```

### What Each Symbol Document Contains

```python
# One document per symbol in the SQLite index
doc = " ".join([
    expand_identifiers(symbol.name),           # "PaymentProviderService payment provider service"
    expand_identifiers(symbol.qualified_name),  # "modules.payment.PaymentProviderService ..."
    symbol.type,                                # "class"
    symbol.parent_qualified_name or "",         # "modules.payment"
    symbol.signature or "",                     # "export default class PaymentProviderService extends ..."
    symbol.file_path,                           # "packages/modules/payment/src/services/payment-provider.ts"
])
```

Each document is ~50-100 tokens (vs ~500 for file-level). Total index
size is similar: 2500 docs * 50 tokens ≈ 500 docs * 250 tokens.

### Why This Fixes Recall

| Failure | Current | With Symbol BM25 |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `PaymentProviderService` not found | BM25 finds file, Stage 2 picks `Payment` (shorter, higher fuzzy score) | BM25 directly ranks `PaymentProviderService` above `Payment` because more query terms match |
| `CheckoutError` not found | BM25 finds checkout file, picks `Checkout` variable | Symbol doc for `CheckoutError` contains "checkout error" — direct hit |
| `DefaultSearchPlugin` not found | BM25 finds search files, picks `reindex` functions | Symbol doc for `DefaultSearchPlugin` contains "default search plugin" — direct hit |
| `check_permissions` not found | BM25 finds channel files (wrong area) | Symbol doc for `check_permissions` contains "check permissions" — query matches directly |
| `createOrUpdateProductVariantPrice` not found | BM25 finds variant files, picks `price` variable | Symbol doc contains full function name — `expand_identifiers` splits it into matching terms |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Symbol-Level BM25 Index (~1.5 hours)

**File**: `code_locator/retrieval/bm25s_client.py`

Add a new method `index_symbols()` alongside existing `index()`:

```python
def index_symbols(self, output_dir: str, symbol_db, k1=1.5, b=0.75):
    """Build BM25 index at symbol granularity."""
    conn = symbol_db._connect()
    rows = conn.execute("""
        SELECT id, name, qualified_name, type, file_path,
               signature, parent_qualified_name
        FROM symbols
    """).fetchall()

    documents = []
    symbol_ids = []
    for row in rows:
        doc = " ".join(filter(None, [
            expand_identifiers(row["name"]),
            expand_identifiers(row["qualified_name"]),
            row["type"],
            expand_identifiers(row["parent_qualified_name"] or ""),
            row["signature"] or "",
            row["file_path"].replace("/", " ").replace(".", " "),
        ]))
        documents.append(doc)
        symbol_ids.append(row["id"])

    tokens = bm25s.tokenize(documents, stopwords="en")
    bm25 = bm25s.BM25(k1=k1, b=b)
    bm25.index(tokens)

    # Persist alongside file-level index
    index_path = Path(output_dir) / "bm25_symbol_index.pkl"
    with open(index_path, "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump({"bm25": bm25, "symbol_ids": symbol_ids}, f)
```

Add `search_symbols()`:

```python
def search_symbols(self, query: str, top_k: int = 20) -> list[dict]:
    """Search symbol-level BM25 index. Returns ranked symbol IDs."""
    query_tokens = bm25s.tokenize([expand_identifiers(query)], stopwords="en")
    results, scores = self._symbol_bm25.retrieve(query_tokens, k=top_k)
    return [
        {"symbol_id": self._symbol_ids[idx], "score": float(score)}
        for idx, score in zip(results[0], scores[0])
        if score > 0
    ]
```

### Phase 2: Wire Into Grounding Pipeline (~1.5 hours)

**File**: `adapters/code_locator.py`

Replace the two-stage `_ground_single()` with symbol-level retrieval:

```python
def _ground_single(self, description, db, max_files, fuzzy_threshold,
                   max_symbols, hits=None, mapping_symbol_names=None):
    # Primary: symbol-level BM25
    sym_hits = self._search_tool.bm25.search_symbols(description, top_k=max_symbols * 3)

    # Resolve symbol IDs to regions
    code_regions = []
    seen_files = set()
    for hit in sym_hits[:max_symbols]:
        row = db.lookup_by_id(hit["symbol_id"])
        if row:
            code_regions.append({
                "symbol": row["qualified_name"] or row["name"],
                "file_path": row["file_path"],
                "start_line": row["start_line"],
                "end_line": row["end_line"],
                "type": row["type"],
                "purpose": description,
            })
            seen_files.add(row["file_path"])

    # Optional: fuse with graph channel for multi-file coverage
    if len(seen_files) < 2 and sym_hits:
        top_ids = [h["symbol_id"] for h in sym_hits[:3]]
        # Graph traversal from top symbols to find related symbols in other files
        ...

    return code_regions
```

This reduces `_ground_single` from ~130 lines to ~30 lines. The coverage
tier loop in `ground_mappings()` still works — it just calls the simpler
`_ground_single` at each tier.

### Phase 3: Dual-Index Fusion (~1 hour)

Keep file-level BM25 as a secondary channel. Fuse symbol-level and
file-level results via RRF:

```python
# In SearchCodeTool.execute():
channels = {
    "bm25_symbols": self.bm25.search_symbols(query, top_k=20),  # NEW
    "bm25_files": self.bm25.search(query, top_k=20),             # existing
    "graph": self._graph_retrieve(symbol_ids) if symbol_ids else [],
}
# RRF fusion with weights:
# symbols: 2.0 (primary), files: 0.5 (fallback), graph: 1.2 (structural)
```

The file-level channel acts as a safety net for symbols the symbol-level
index might miss (e.g., symbols mentioned only in file body, not in
their own name/signature).

### Phase 4: Index Lifecycle (~30 min)

**File**: `code_locator_runtime.py`

After `build_index()` and `bm25.index()`, also call `bm25.index_symbols()`:

```python
bm25 = Bm25sClient()
bm25.index(repo, index_dir, symbol_db=_sdb)       # file-level (existing)
bm25.index_symbols(index_dir, symbol_db=_sdb)      # symbol-level (new)
```

Lazy-load the symbol index in `Bm25sClient._load()`.

### Phase 5: Eval + Tune (~1 hour)

- Run eval on all 3 repos
- Tune RRF channel weights (symbol vs file vs graph)
- Verify MRR >= 0.75, target recall >= 45%
- Run full 49-test suite

## Expected Impact

| Metric | Before | After (projected) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| MRR@3 | 0.786 | ~0.82 (symbol-level more precise) |
| Recall | 29.9% | ~50% (directly finding correct symbols) |
| FP Rate | 30-55% | ~15-25% (fewer irrelevant symbols) |
| `_ground_single` complexity | 130 lines, 2 stages | ~30 lines, 1 stage |

### Why 50% and not higher

- 6/30 decisions have empty `expected_symbols` → always recall=0 (20% ceiling loss)
- ~4 decisions describe features with no matching code at all
- Some expected symbols don't appear anywhere in the description
  (e.g., `check_permissions` in "Channel-scoped JWT permissions")
- Theoretical ceiling with current ground truth: ~65%

## Risks

1. **Symbol documents may be too short for BM25**: Very short documents
   can cause BM25 scoring anomalies. Mitigate by ensuring minimum
   document length (repeat symbol name if doc < 10 tokens).

2. **Loss of file-level context**: Some decisions describe file-level
   concepts ("the payment module"). Mitigate by keeping file-level BM25
   as an RRF channel.

3. **Index rebuild required**: All repos need re-indexing. The symbol
   data is already in SQLite — no re-parsing needed, just BM25 rebuild.

4. **Test breakage**: `test_fc2_multi_region_grounding.py` mocks
   `search_code` — symbol-level search would need new mocks. Coverage
   loop tests mock `_ground_single` directly — they still work.
