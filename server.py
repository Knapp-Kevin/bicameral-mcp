"""Bicameral MCP Server — Bicameral decision ledger + code locator tools.

13 tools:
  bicameral.link_commit       — heartbeat: sync a commit into the decision ledger
  bicameral.ingest            — ingest normalized decision/code evidence and advance source cursors
  bicameral.update            — check for or apply a recommended bicameral-mcp update
  bicameral.reset             — wipe ledger rows scoped to the current repo
  bicameral.preflight         — proactive context surfacing before implementation
  bicameral.judge_gaps        — caller-LLM business-requirement gap judge
  bicameral.resolve_compliance — caller-LLM compliance verdict write-back (v0.5.0 three-way)
  bicameral.ratify            — product sign-off on a decision (double-entry ledger)
  bicameral.history           — read-only ledger dump grouped by feature area
  bicameral.dashboard         — launch live decision dashboard with SSE push updates
  validate_symbols            — fuzzy-match candidate symbol names against the code index
  get_neighbors               — 1-hop structural graph traversal around a symbol
  extract_symbols             — tree-sitter symbol extraction from a source file

Run with: bicameral-mcp (or python server.py) for stdio transport.

Env vars:
  REPO_PATH=.                — path to the repo being analyzed
  SURREAL_URL=surrealkv://~/.bicameral/ledger.db — SurrealDB URL (use memory:// for tests)
  CODE_LOCATOR_SQLITE_DB     — optional override for the local code index DB
