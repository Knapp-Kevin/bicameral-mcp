"""Bicameral MCP Server — Bicameral decision ledger + code locator tools.

9 tools:
  bicameral.status       — surface implementation status of tracked decisions
  bicameral.search       — pre-flight: find past decisions relevant to a query
  bicameral.drift        — code review: surface decisions touched by a file
  bicameral.link_commit  — heartbeat: sync a commit into the decision ledger
  bicameral.ingest       — ingest normalized decision/code evidence and advance source cursors
  validate_symbols       — fuzzy-match candidate symbol names against the code index
  search_code            — BM25 + graph search with RRF fusion
  get_neighbors          — 1-hop structural graph traversal around a symbol
  extract_symbols        — tree-sitter symbol extraction from a source file

Run with: bicameral-mcp (or python server.py) for stdio transport.

Env vars:
  REPO_PATH=.                — path to the repo being analyzed
  SURREAL_URL=surrealkv://~/.bicameral/ledger.db — SurrealDB URL (use memory:// for tests)
  CODE_LOCATOR_SQLITE_DB     — optional override for the local code index DB
