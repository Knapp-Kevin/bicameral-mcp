# Shadow Genome

Recorded failure modes for the QorLogic chain. Each entry captures a
verdict-rejecting pattern so future planning avoids it.

---

## Failure Entry #1

**Date**: 2026-04-28T01:06:38Z
**Verdict ID**: AUDIT_REPORT.md @ chain hash `c31802d7...`
**Failure Mode**: HALLUCINATION (V1/V2 — residual `{{verify}}` tags)

### What Failed
`plan-codegenome-phase-1-2.md` shipped to `/qor-audit` with two
unresolved `{{verify: ...}}` tags (lines 19, 143).

### Why It Failed
The qor-plan grounding doctrine (Step 2b) declares: "Residual
`{{verify: ...}}` tags in a plan block its submission." Both tags had
contextually legitimate purposes:
- Line 19: documenting a deferred decision (release-eng version pin)
- Line 143: pairing a verifiable assertion with the test that verifies it

But the doctrine is binary — *any* residual `{{verify}}` blocks. The
governor used the tags as informal annotations rather than resolving or
removing them before submission.

### Pattern to Avoid
`{{verify: ...}}` is a *working-file* annotation, not a *submission-grade*
artifact. Before submission to audit:
- If the claim is *deferred* to another decision-maker (e.g. release-eng),
  rewrite as plain prose stating the deferral and its owner.
- If the claim is *self-resolving* via a planned test or check, delete
  the tag — the test or check is the verification.
- If the claim is genuinely uncertain and cannot be deferred or
  self-resolved, the plan is not yet ready for audit; resolve before
  submission.

### Remediation Attempted
Plan to be edited per AUDIT_REPORT.md remediation #1 (pin `0.11.0`
placeholder + plain prose deferral) and #2 (delete in-plan tag — let test
stand). Re-submission for `/qor-audit` follows.

## Failure Entry #2

**Date**: 2026-04-28T01:06:38Z
**Verdict ID**: AUDIT_REPORT.md @ chain hash `c31802d7...`
**Failure Mode**: ORPHAN / SCOPE_CREEP (V3 — `SubjectIdentityModel`)

### What Failed
Phase 1 of `plan-codegenome-phase-1-2.md` proposed four Pydantic models
in `codegenome/contracts.py`. The upstream issue #59 mandates only three:
`SubjectCandidateModel`, `EvidenceRecordModel`, `EvidencePacketModel`.
The fourth, `SubjectIdentityModel`, is not in the issue, has no caller in
the plan, and is not covered by any test.

### Why It Failed
The user's anti-goal Q2=B authorized exactly one Phase-3 foundation
artifact: the `subject_version` table (so the schema migration fires
once, not twice). `SubjectIdentityModel` does not fall under that
exception — it is an unrelated stub for a future MCP-boundary surface
that #59 does not deliver.

### Pattern to Avoid
**Symmetry is not a justification.** "All four dataclasses get Pydantic
mirrors" is an aesthetic argument, not a YAGNI-compliant one. When an
issue lists three deliverables, deliver three. Future phases that need
the fourth mirror can add it under their own justification, with their
own caller, in their own PR. Audit checks issue-mandate ∩ caller-
existence; symmetry-driven extras fail both.

### Remediation Attempted
Plan to be edited per AUDIT_REPORT.md remediation #3: remove
`SubjectIdentityModel` from the Phase 1 deliverables list in
`plan-codegenome-phase-1-2.md` so the implementation phase does not
write the unjustified mirror. Re-submission for `/qor-audit` follows.

---

## Failure Entry #3 (Phase 3 plan, #60)

**Date**: 2026-04-28T03:18:53Z
**Verdict ID**: AUDIT_REPORT.md @ chain hash `7fad1059...`
**Failure Mode**: ORPHAN / MACRO-ARCHITECTURE (V1, V2, V3 — coupled
build-path incompleteness)

### What Failed
`plan-codegenome-phase-3.md`'s auto-resolve recipe inside
`evaluate_continuity_for_drift` (line 203):

> "On ≥0.75: writes `subject_version`, `identity_supersedes`, calls
> `update_binds_to_region`, returns `ContinuityResolution`..."

The recipe enumerates three terminal writes but omits four prerequisite
writes that are required to make the terminal writes valid:

- The new `subject_identity` row that `identity_supersedes(old, new)`
  references.
- The new `code_region` row that `update_binds_to_region(...,
  new_region_id)` references.
- The `has_version` edge that connects `code_subject` to the newly
  written `subject_version` row (otherwise the row is unreachable).
- The `compute_identity_with_neighbors` call that produces the new
  identity values used by both the new `subject_identity` row and the
  new `subject_version` row.

### Why It Failed
The plan was written from the issue body's bullet list ("write
subject_version / write identity_supersedes / update binds_to") and
treated those bullets as the *complete* sequence rather than as the
*terminal* sequence. Each terminal write has a graph-theoretic
prerequisite (the target row must exist before a RELATE can reference
it) that was implicit in the issue but not enumerated in the plan.

### Pattern to Avoid
When a plan describes ledger writes that involve RELATE statements,
enumerate every prerequisite upsert by name. Treat "writes X" as a
single bullet only if X is a node, never if X is an edge — edges
require both endpoints to exist. A plan that says "write
identity_supersedes" must also say where the OUT endpoint comes from.
The audit pass that catches this is *macro-architecture: build path is
intentional* — same checkbox, different scale (data flow rather than
module flow).

### Remediation Attempted
Plan to be edited per AUDIT_REPORT.md required remediations `#1`, `#2`,
and `#3`: extend `evaluate_continuity_for_drift` description with the
7-step sequence (compute_identity → upsert_code_region →
upsert_subject_identity → write_subject_version → relate_has_version
→ write_identity_supersedes → update_binds_to_region); add the
missing `relate_has_version` query + adapter wrapper to the plan;
update integration-test fixture-setup descriptions to verify the
prerequisite rows. Re-submission for `/qor-audit` follows.

## Failure Entry #3

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Phase:** AUDIT (Phase 4 / Issue #61)
**Persona:** Judge

### What Failed

`plan-codegenome-phase-4.md` received VETO with five blocking findings.
The Governor's plan invoked **non-existent infrastructure** (CHANGEFEED
on `compliance_check`, `extract_calls` API on `symbol_extractor`),
introduced a **dead enum value** (`pre_classification_hint` in the
`semantic_status` ASSERT with no writer), used a **wrong language
identifier** (`csharp` vs `c_sharp`), and the M3 benchmark corpus
**did not honour the multi-language scope** chosen at planning time
(Q2=B): no uncertain-band fixtures for non-Python; Java + C# got zero
fixtures of any kind.

### Why It Failed

**Root cause:** the plan was written from architectural intuition
without grounding the API references and schema claims against the
actual code. Every one of F1–F4 collapsed under direct file read:

- F1 was contradicted by `ledger/schema.py:186` (no CHANGEFEED on
  `compliance_check`).
- F3 was contradicted by `code_locator/indexing/symbol_extractor.py:64`
  (`c_sharp`, not `csharp`).
- F4 was contradicted by the public-function listing of
  `symbol_extractor.py` (only `extract_symbols*` — no `extract_calls`).

The plan trusted memory of how the code "ought to" work rather than
re-reading. When the plan was forwarded to `/qor-audit` without that
ground-check pass, the audit caught the gap — but the cost was a full
plan-revision cycle.

F2 (dead enum) and F5 (test corpus scope mismatch) are different in
kind: they're **internal inconsistencies** within the plan itself.
F2 lists a value the plan never writes; F5 promises multi-language
coverage in the deliverables but only delivers Python coverage in the
fixture inventory. These are catchable by re-reading the plan against
itself before submission.

### Pattern to Avoid

**SG-PLAN-GROUNDING-DRIFT.** When writing a plan that references an
existing API (function, schema field, language identifier, table
property), the Governor must:

1. Open the referenced file.
2. Verify the symbol exists and matches the spelling used in the plan.
3. If the plan asserts a property of the schema/code (e.g. "table X has
   CHANGEFEED Y"), grep for the property and confirm.

Plans that skip this step ship invented infrastructure that the audit
must catch. Each invention is a V1 (orphan) or V2 (broken contract)
violation. The grounding cost (~5 minutes of greps) is far less than
a re-plan cycle (~hours of rewrite + re-audit).

**SG-PLAN-INTERNAL-INCONSISTENCY.** When a plan picks a scope
(multi-language, additive-only schema, etc.) it must be honoured in
EVERY section that references that scope:

- Affected-files lists.
- Test plan.
- Fixture inventory.
- Razor pre-check.
- Risk table.

A scope that lives only in the §Open-Questions or §Composition-Principles
sections but degrades silently in §Test-Plan or §Phase-N is the same
class of failure as F5. Internal consistency is a precondition for
submission to `/qor-audit`.

### Remediation Attempted

VETO issued. Governor must revise the plan addressing F1–F5 and
resubmit for `/qor-audit`. Recommended remediation paths are listed
in each finding's "Required remediation" section of the audit report.

The five non-blocking observations (O1–O5) should also be addressed
in the revision pass for plan hygiene, but do not on their own block
re-audit PASS.

### Auto-counter on resubmission

When the revised plan is submitted, the Judge will specifically
ground-check every API reference and schema claim against the
codebase before issuing PASS. The grounding sweep is non-optional
for L2 plans that touch schema or extend an existing module API.

## Failure Entry #5

**Date**: 2026-04-29
**Phase**: GATE / qor-audit (v1 of #44 plan, commit `b15c9ef`)
**Pattern**: SG-PLAN-GROUNDING-DRIFT (instance #2 in this session)

### What happened

Plan `plan-codegenome-llm-drift-judge.md` (v1) instructed the implementer to modify `pilot/mcp/skills/bicameral-sync/SKILL.md` and added a unit test (`test_pilot_skill_md_matches_skills_skill_md`) that diffed two copies of SKILL.md across `skills/` and `pilot/mcp/skills/`. The plan author (this session) inherited the claim from `CLAUDE.md` ("`pilot/mcp/skills/` is the **single canonical location**") without empirically verifying it.

Reality on `dev` HEAD (`200dbd5`):

```
$ ls pilot/
ls: cannot access 'pilot/': No such file or directory
```

The directory does not exist. The plan was unimplementable as written.

### Detection

Audit Step 3 — orphan detection pass — flagged `pilot/mcp/skills/bicameral-sync/SKILL.md` as a build-path orphan. Backwalking to the plan revealed it was a directive, not a typo; a literal `ls` confirmed the directory's absence.

### Mitigation

1. v2 of the plan (commit `d846a4a`) removed the directive, removed the matching test, and added a rationale note identifying CLAUDE.md's reference as stale.
2. Plan author should `ls` every directory it proposes to modify before issuing the plan, not trust `CLAUDE.md` verbatim for filesystem layout.
3. Auditor's orphan detection should run on every plan, not just code-bearing ones.

### Cross-references

- **Instance #1**: `DEV_CYCLE.md` §9 (PR #93) absorbed the same `pilot/mcp/skills/` reference into a "skill file rule (project-specific, mandatory)" callout. Same root cause; landed undetected because PR #93 was a docs PR with no orphan check.
- **Followup workstream**: `docs:claude-md-cleanup` issue (to be filed) — fixes `CLAUDE.md` itself so future plans don't keep inheriting the stale assertion.

### Pattern signature

```
SG-PLAN-GROUNDING-DRIFT
  Trigger:        plan author trusts a documented assertion about
                  filesystem state without empirical verification.
  Failure mode:   plan instructs work on files that don't exist;
                  unit test references nonexistent path; orphan
                  detection catches it at audit (best case) or
                  implementation runtime (worst case).
  Countermeasure: every directory cited in a plan's "affected
                  files" section must be `ls`-confirmed before
                  the plan is submitted for audit. Add a Step 2b
                  Grounding Protocol clause if not already present.
```
