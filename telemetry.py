"""Anonymous, privacy-first telemetry for bicameral-mcp.

Events are sent to a Cloudflare Worker relay (telemetry-relay/) which validates
the schema, rate-limits per device, and forwards to PostHog using a server-side
secret. The PostHog API key is never in this file or any client code.

## Relay contract (stable — never changes)

The relay enforces exactly two invariants and passes everything else through:
  1. `distinct_id` must be present and a string.
  2. `version` must be present and a string.
  3. `diagnostic` values, if present, must be numeric (int/float/bool) — no strings.

Any other top-level field flows through to PostHog as-is. Adding new event types
or new properties never requires a relay redeploy.

## Privacy invariants (enforced client-side before sending)

What IS collected:
  - Any string field explicitly added by the caller (e.g. skill name, event type)
  - Server version
  - Numeric/boolean metrics (duration, counts, flags)

What is NEVER collected:
  - Decision descriptions, transcript text, or any user-supplied text
  - File paths, repo names, or identifying path information
  - Search queries, code snippets, or any code content
  - Meeting, PRD, or Slack content of any kind

The distinct_id is a random UUID stored at ~/.bicameral/device_id — generated once
per machine, never linked to a real identity. There is no cross-session linkage.

Opt out at any time:
  export BICAMERAL_TELEMETRY=0        # environment variable
  BICAMERAL_TELEMETRY=0 bicameral-mcp # one-off per invocation

Data lives in Bicameral's private PostHog project. To access the team dashboard,
reach out to jin@bicameral-ai.com.
