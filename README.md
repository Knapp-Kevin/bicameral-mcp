**A provenance-aware decision layer for your codebase** -- paste a transcript, get a living map of what was decided and what was actually built.

Bicameral MCP is a local-first [Model Context Protocol](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that ingests meeting transcripts, PRDs, and design documents, builds a structured graph of decisions mapped to code symbols, and continuously tracks whether those decisions are reflected, drifting, or lost as the codebase evolves. No data leaves your machine. No LLM required -- all retrieval is deterministic. No API keys needed.

## The Problem

Every software team makes hundreds of verbal decisions per week -- in meetings, PRDs, Slack threads, and huddles. None of those decisions are linked to the code that implements them. This disconnect creates five specific SDLC friction points:

| # | Smell | What Happens | Bicameral Fix |
|---|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | **CONSTRAINT_LOST** | A rate limit or compliance rule surfaces mid-sprint instead of at design time | `bicameral.search` -- pre-flight context before coding |
| 2 | **CONTEXT_SCATTERED** | The "why" behind a decision is split across Slack, Notion, and someone's memory | `bicameral.ingest` -- normalizes intent from any source into a unified graph |
| 3 | **DECISION_UNDOCUMENTED** | A verbal "let's do X" never lands in a ticket or ADR | `bicameral.status` -- tracks what was decided vs. what was built |
| 4 | **REPEATED_EXPLANATION** | Same context tax paid twice -- once to design, once to engineering | `bicameral.search` -- retrieves full decision provenance on demand |
| 5 | **TRIBAL_KNOWLEDGE** | Only one person knows why the system works the way it does | `bicameral.drift` -- surfaces institutional memory tied to code |

Bicameral's core value is **drift detection** -- knowing that a decision made three weeks ago is now inconsistent with what actually shipped, or that a decision made today is inconsistent with the codebase reality.

---

## How It Works

### Status Derivation Model

Decision status is a **pure function** computed at query time -- never stored. This is the key differentiator: because status is derived from `(intent, git_ref)`, Bicameral is immune to rebase, squash, and cherry-pick. There is no stale state to reconcile.

| Condition | Status | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| No `code_region` mapped | **ungrounded** | Intent captured, but no matching code found |
| Symbol absent at git ref | **pending** | Code not yet written |
| `content_hash` differs | **drifted** | Code changed since the decision was recorded |
| `content_hash` matches | **reflected** | Code matches intent |

### Auto-Grounding

When decisions are ingested, Bicameral automatically attempts to anchor them to code:

1. **BM25 file-level search** -- ranks candidate files by textual relevance to the decision description
2. **Symbol expansion** -- extracts all symbols from top-ranked files via tree-sitter
3. **Fuzzy token matching** -- matches decision terminology against the symbol index using rapidfuzz

This is a deterministic, two-stage retrieval pipeline. No embeddings, no LLM calls.

## Architecture

Bicameral is composed of three layers:

|-----------|------|
| **Ingest** | Transcript/PRD --> `bicameral.ingest` --> SurrealDB graph (intents, symbols, code_regions, edges) |
| **Sync** | Code change --> `bicameral.link_commit` --> content hash update, drift re-evaluation |
| **Query** | `bicameral.status` / `drift` / `search` --> derives status from `(intent, git_ref)` at query time |

**Supported languages** (tree-sitter grammars): Python, JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, TSX, Java, Go, Rust, C#

## Quickstart

### One-command setup

```bash
pipx install bicameral-mcp
bicameral-mcp setup
```

This launches an interactive wizard that:
1. Detects your repo (from cwd or prompts you)
2. Installs the MCP config into Claude Code using your `pipx` binary path

That's it. The server builds its code index on first tool call.

### Manual config

Run from your repo root:

```bash
# Install
pipx install bicameral-mcp

# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add-json bicameral --scope local '{
  "command": "bicameral-mcp",
  "args": [],
  "env": {
    "REPO_PATH": "/path/to/your/repo",
    "SURREAL_URL": "surrealkv:///path/to/your/repo/.bicameral/ledger.db"
  }
}'
```

### Local development

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
bicameral-mcp setup           # interactive config
bicameral-mcp --smoke-test    # verify all 9 tools register correctly
bicameral-mcp                 # start MCP server (stdio)
```

### Verify installation

```bash
bicameral-mcp --smoke-test
```

Expected output:
```
bicameral-mcp 0.2.13 smoke test passed
bicameral.status
bicameral.search
bicameral.drift
bicameral.link_commit
bicameral.ingest
validate_symbols
search_code
get_neighbors
extract_symbols
```

No LLM provider credentials needed -- all retrieval is deterministic.

## MCP Tools Reference

### Ledger Tools (5)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bicameral.status` | Surface implementation status of all tracked decisions (reflected / drifted / pending / ungrounded) |
| `bicameral.search` | Pre-flight: find past decisions relevant to a feature before writing code. Auto-syncs to HEAD. |
| `bicameral.drift` | Code review: surface decisions that touch symbols in a file, flagging divergence |
| `bicameral.link_commit` | Sync a commit into the ledger -- updates content hashes, re-evaluates drift. Idempotent. |
| `bicameral.ingest` | Ingest a normalized source payload (transcript, PRD, Slack export) and advance the source cursor |

### Code Locator Tools (4)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `validate_symbols` | Fuzzy-match candidate symbol names against the code index. Returns confidence scores and symbol IDs. |
| `search_code` | BM25 text search + structural graph traversal with RRF fusion. Optionally seed with symbol IDs. |
| `get_neighbors` | 1-hop structural graph traversal around a symbol (callers, callees, imports, inheritance). |
| `extract_symbols` | Tree-sitter symbol extraction from a source file. No index required. |

## Tool Composition

The nine tools are designed to compose into three primary workflows:

### Pre-flight (before coding)

```
bicameral.search("add rate limiting to checkout")
  --> surfaces prior constraints, related decisions, and their code regions
  --> auto-syncs ledger to HEAD before returning results
```

Use this to check for prior art and constraints before writing new code. Prevents CONSTRAINT_LOST and REPEATED_EXPLANATION.

### Code review (before merging)

```
bicameral.drift("payments/processor.py")
  --> surfaces all decisions touching symbols in this file
  --> flags any where the code has diverged from recorded intent

bicameral.status(filter="drifted")
  --> full drift report across the entire codebase
```

Use this in pull request review to catch unintentional drift. The `use_working_tree` parameter controls whether comparison is against disk (pre-commit) or HEAD (PR review).

### Ingestion (after a meeting)

```
bicameral.ingest(payload)
  --> extracts intents, auto-grounds to code symbols
  --> advances source cursor for incremental sync

bicameral.link_commit("HEAD")
  --> syncs latest commit state into the ledger

bicameral.status(since="2025-03-20")
  --> shows what's reflected vs. pending since the meeting
```

---

## Testing

Bicameral has 42 test files organized into three phases, all using real adapters with `SURREAL_URL=memory://` (embedded, in-process SurrealDB -- no external services required).

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

| Phase | Entry Point | Scope |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Phase 1** | `test_phase1_code_locator.py` | Code locator tools against a real indexed repository |
| **Phase 2** | `test_phase2_ledger.py` | SurrealDB ledger adapter with `memory://` -- CRUD, graph traversal, cursor management |
| **Phase 3** | `test_phase3_integration.py` | Full end-to-end: structured around the 5 SDLC failure modes |

Additional test suites cover adversarial inputs (`test_stress_adversarial.py`), failure modes (`test_stress_failure_modes.py`), grounding state machine gaps (`test_grounding_state_machine_gaps.py`), and server smoke tests (`test_server_smoke.py`).

Phase 3 tests produce JSON artifacts (`test-results/e2e/`) with full tool responses and SurrealDB graph dumps for qualitative review. CI runs via GitHub Actions on PRs to `main`, with JUnit XML and HTML reports uploaded as artifacts.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REPO_PATH` | `.` | Path to the repository being analyzed |
| `SURREAL_URL` | `surrealkv://~/.bicameral/ledger.db` | SurrealDB connection URL. Use `memory://` for tests (no persistence). |
| `CODE_LOCATOR_SQLITE_DB` | *(auto)* | Optional override for the local code index database path |

All data is stored locally. The embedded SurrealDB instance runs in-process -- no separate database server to manage.

## Roadmap

### CodeGenome Identity Layer

The current system grounds decisions via symbol names and file paths. This works well for stable codebases, but location-based anchoring breaks when code is renamed, moved, or heavily refactored.

The next major evolution -- **CodeGenome** -- replaces location-based anchoring with identity-based grounding: structural signatures and behavioral profiles that persist across renames, moves, and AI-driven rewrites. This resolves what we call the **Auto-Grounding Problem**: intent anchored to identity rather than location.

Where Bicameral today maps `intent --> symbol_name --> file:line`, CodeGenome will map `intent --> structural_identity --> any_location`, making the decision graph resilient to large-scale codebase reorganization.
