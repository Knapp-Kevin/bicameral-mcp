"""Issue #44 — judge-corpus contract tests.

Validates the shape of ``expected_judge`` entries on uncertain-band
M3 benchmark cases. Pure data validation — does NOT call an LLM, does
NOT touch SurrealDB, does NOT hit the network.

The ``expected_judge`` field is the human-authored ground truth for
the operator QC pass at substantiation: each uncertain case declares
the (verdict, semantic_status) pair the LLM judge SHOULD produce. The
operator compares actual LLM output against these labels.

Per the plan's D5 rule: when ``verdict == "not_relevant"``, axis 2
(cosmetic-vs-semantic) does not apply, so ``semantic_status`` must
be ``None``.
