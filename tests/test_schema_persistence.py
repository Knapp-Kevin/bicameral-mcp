"""Persistent-db schema smoke tests.

Runs init_schema and migrate against a real file-backed surrealkv:// database
(not memory://) to catch idempotency regressions, migration chain failures,
and schema compatibility errors before they ship.

These tests must NOT be run with SURREAL_URL=memory:// — each test creates
its own isolated surrealkv path under pytest's tmp_path fixture.
