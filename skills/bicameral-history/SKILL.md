# Bicameral History

Returns a read-only snapshot of everything in the decision ledger, grouped
by feature area, in a shape the dashboard and `/decisions` page can consume
directly.

## When to fire

- *"show the decision history"*
- *"list all decisions"*
- *"what's in the ledger"*
- *"show me everything tracked"*
- *"give me the full decision list"*
- *"what decisions have been recorded"*

## When NOT to fire

- Implementation verbs ("add", "build", "implement") → use `bicameral-preflight`
- Ingest / transcript phrasing → use `bicameral-ingest`
- Drift or drift-by-file questions → out of wedge

## Telemetry

**At skill start**:
```
bicameral.skill_begin(skill_name="bicameral-history", session_id=<uuid4>,
  rationale="<one-liner: e.g. 'user asked to show full decision ledger'>")
```

**At skill end**:
```
bicameral.skill_end(skill_name="bicameral-history", session_id=<stored_id>,
  errored=<bool>, error_class="ledger_empty" if empty ledger else None)
```

## Tool call

```
bicameral.history(
  feature_filter="<optional substring>",   # narrow to one feature
  include_superseded=True,                 # default: include superseded
  as_of="<git-ref>",                       # default: HEAD
)
```

## Before rendering — handle pending compliance checks

Check `response._pending_compliance_checks`. If non-empty, a new commit was
detected and compliance is unresolved — **status will be wrong until you resolve
it.** Use the `bicameral-sync` compliance resolution flow:

For each check: read `file_path`, evaluate code against `decision_description`,
batch all verdicts into one call:

```
bicameral.resolve_compliance(
  phase="drift",
  flow_id="<response._pending_flow_id>",
  verdicts=[{
    decision_id:  "<check.decision_id>",
    region_id:    "<check.region_id>",
    content_hash: "<check.content_hash — echo exactly>",
    verdict:      "compliant" | "drifted" | "not_relevant",
    confidence:   "high" | "medium" | "low",
    explanation:  "<one sentence>"
  }, ...]
)
```

Then render the history table as normal.

## How to present

Group decisions by `HistoryFeature`. For each group:

1. **Header**: `FEATURE NAME  Nreflected  Ndrifted  Nungrounded  Nsuperseded`
   - Lead with features that have drifted or ungrounded decisions.
2. **Decisions in the group** — render as a tree, not a flat list:
   - Use `parent_decision_id` to identify L2/L3 decisions. Render L1 roots first (sorted by status priority), then indent each L2 child under its L1 parent, and L3 children under their L2 parent.
   - Indent L2 by 2 spaces + `[L2]` prefix. Indent L3 by 4 spaces + `[L3]` prefix. L1 decisions get an `[L1]` prefix.
   - Left symbol = code status: `✓` reflected · `⚠` drifted · `○` ungrounded · `~` ungrounded + AI-surfaced
   - Right symbol = signoff: `✓ date` ratified · `○` proposed · `~` AI-surfaced · `✕` rejected · `⚑` needs context · `—` superseded
   - Include `sources`, `fulfillments[].file_path:start_line`, and `drift_evidence` when present.
   - If `decision_level` is absent, treat the decision as L1 (flat/legacy).

Example layout:
```
FEATURE NAME   3 reflected   1 drifted   2 ungrounded

[L1] ✓ top-level decision                              ✓ 2026-04-20
       file.py:42  Source: meeting-2026-04-01
     [L2]   ✓ child decision (indented)                ✓ 2026-04-20
             file.py:88
     [L2]   ⚠ drifted child                            ✓ 2026-03-15
             Drift: content changed since last sync
[L1] ○ ungrounded top-level                            ○
```

When `truncated=True`, note "Showing 50 of N features — use `feature_filter` to drill in."

## After rendering — surface unratified proposals

After the history table, scan the rendered decisions for any whose
`signoff.state == "proposed"` (i.e. not yet ratified). Group them by
feature area and present a single ratify prompt:

```
○ Unratified proposals in: <Feature A>, <Feature B>, <Feature C>
   Drift tracking is paused on these until ratified.
   Ratify now? [Y/n or pick features: A C]  ›
```

- If the user confirms all or a subset, call `bicameral.ratify` for
  each decision in the confirmed features (same call as
  `bicameral-ingest` step 7).
- If they decline, note it inline and move on — never ask twice in
  the same session.
- **Silent when there are no proposals.** Never say "nothing to
  ratify." The empty path is always silent.

This is the canonical ratification surface. `bicameral-ingest` and
`bicameral-capture-corrections` both leave decisions as proposals
deliberately — history is where the user reviews and ratifies in
bulk, rather than being asked at the end of every ingest.

## Badges

**Status** (code-compliance — left column):

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ | reflected — code matches |
| ⚠ | drifted — code diverged |
| ○ | ungrounded — no code region yet |
| ~ | ungrounded + AI-surfaced (`signoff.discovered=true`) |

**Signoff** (human-approval — right column):

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ date | ratified |
| ○ | proposed (human-ingested) |
| ~ | proposed, AI-surfaced |
| ✕ | rejected |
| ⚑ | needs context |
| — | superseded |

**Note on ephemeral commits**: when a decision's current status was determined by a
feature-branch commit (not yet in the authoritative branch), `ephemeral: true` is set
on the `HistoryDecision`. Status (`drifted`/`reflected`) is still valid — it represents
the live branch state. The dashboard renders a `⎇` badge in the state cell with tooltip
"Status from feature branch — not yet verified on main". In your text rendering, append
`⎇` after the status badge for ephemeral decisions.
