"""Handler for /bicameral_preflight MCP tool (v0.4.12).

Proactive context surfacing: agents call this BEFORE implementing
code to get a gated context block. The handler:

  1. Validates the topic deterministically (≥4 chars, ≥2 content tokens,
     not a generic catch-all). Failed validation → fired=False.
  2. Checks per-session dedup — if the same topic was preflight-checked
     within the last 5 minutes, fired=False.
  3. Calls ``handle_search_decisions(topic)`` internally.
  4. Empty matches → fired=False with reason=no_matches.
  5. **Gating**:
     - guided_mode=False (normal): fired=True only when matches contain
       drift, ungrounded decisions, or (after brief chain) divergences /
       open questions. "Less intense" — silent on plain matches.
     - guided_mode=True (standard): fired=True on any matches.
  6. Conditionally chains to ``handle_brief(topic)`` when matches contain
     drift or ungrounded status — that's where divergences and gaps live.
  7. Returns a ``PreflightResponse`` with everything composed.

The gate logic lives in Python (here), not in the skill markdown, so
it's enforced regardless of agent compliance. The skill is a thin
wrapper that calls this tool and renders the response when fired=True.

Trust contract: ``fired=False`` means the agent produces ZERO OUTPUT to
the user. No "I checked and found nothing" noise. The empty path is
silent.
