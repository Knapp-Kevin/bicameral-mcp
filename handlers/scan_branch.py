"""Handler for /scan_branch MCP tool (v0.4.17).

Multi-file drift audit. Given a base ref and a head ref, returns
every decision that touches any file changed between the two refs,
deduped by ``intent_id`` and classified by status.

This is the multi-file counterpart to ``bicameral.drift`` — the
tool the agent reaches for when the user asks "what's drifted on
this branch?" instead of "is pricing.py drifted?". Composes
existing primitives:

- ``ledger.status.get_changed_files_in_range`` — v0.4.11 git-diff
  machinery, already used by ``link_commit`` for its latent-drift
  range sweep
- ``ledger.status.resolve_ref`` — v0.4.17 ref resolver, handles
  branch names / tags / short SHAs
- ``ctx.ledger.get_decisions_for_file`` — per-file decision lookup
  with v0.4.14 source_excerpt plumbing
- ``handlers.detect_drift.raw_decisions_to_drift_entries`` — the
  exact mapping extracted in v0.4.17 so scan_branch and drift
  produce byte-identical per-entry output

The handler never calls an LLM. It's a deterministic composition
over the range-diff sweep.
