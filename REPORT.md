# Bicameral MCP v0.9.3 — Simulation Report (v3)

**Date**: 2026-04-26  
**Target repo**: `../Accountable-App-3.0`  
**Source data**: Slack `#accountable-tech` channel  
**Script**: `scripts/sim_accountable.py`

---

## Bugs fixed during this simulation

Four bugs were discovered and fixed while running this report:

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| B1 | `IngestMapping` missing `decision_level` + `parent_decision_id` — `_normalize_payload` called `model_dump()` which stripped fields not in the Pydantic schema | Added both fields to `IngestMapping` in `contracts.py` |
| B2 | `HistoryDecision.decision_level` always `None` — `_fetch_all_decisions_enriched` inline query didn't `SELECT decision_level` or `parent_decision_id` | Added both fields to the inline SELECT in `handlers/history.py` |
| B3 | `HistoryFeature.name` showed `?` in v1 simulation — script bug, used `fg.feature_group` instead of `fg.name` | Fixed in simulation script (not a server bug) |
| B4 | `IngestResponse` missing `created_decisions` — callers couldn't get decision IDs post-ingest without fuzzy text matching | Added `CreatedDecision` model + `created_decisions` field to `IngestResponse`; wired through `adapter.py` and `handlers/ingest.py` |

---

## Run 1 — Ingest + created_decisions verification

**11 decisions ingested from Slack `#accountable-tech`. All created, 0 grounded (expected — no code spans in Slack data).**

```
Stats: 11 created, 0 grounded, 11 ungrounded

created_decisions field: 11 entries (all decisions, grounded + ungrounded)

  [L1] decision:p3dl0of44tao9wlwy8ak  "All code changes must go to staging first via PR..."
  [L2] decision:2bvqinvcfkqi7odwqr17  "Staging environment mirrors prod with real integr..."
  [L1] decision:zvigw6xuyjnc0rda4mgr  "Brian Borg acts as engineering quarterback..."
  [L2] decision:5ijcfaavcb1rozdl62sv  "All high-value secrets live in Supabase secrets..."
  [L1] decision:9z2v2z2s4fhwvl07ycjf  "Sentry auth token must be rotated and marked Sens..."
  [L2] decision:z5wi72g765k1epiu14kv  "Assess Sentry vs PostHog — PostHog now captures..."
  [L1] decision:50swds1osn6jmi624fwv  "Individual coaching portal for 1:1 clients..."
  [L2] decision:p7r6uts6oylyxdtm5enu  "Weekly workshop module should be a repeatable..."
  [L1] decision:g8sxxt5ayzqr601d43vf  "Users can view their daily check-in history..."
  [L2] decision:1cnudj8v3d6167h48oz4  "Claude reasoning level should be task-appropriate..."
  [L2] decision:vxts43osh9empepwien2  "Weekly community bulletin delivered as dynamic page..."

L1 filter: pending_grounding_decisions has 6 entries, 0 L1 — PASS
```

**Observations:**
- `created_decisions` field (new in v0.9.3) returns all decision IDs with exact levels. Callers no longer need fuzzy text matching to find newly-created IDs.
- L1 filter on `pending_grounding_decisions` correctly excludes the 5 L1 decisions — only the 6 L2 decisions appear as requiring code binding.
- `decision_level` flows correctly through `IngestMapping` → `adapter.py` → `IngestResponse` after fixing B1.

---

## Run 2 — Preflight regression

```
Topic: 'weekly workshop module repeatable component'
Fired: True, decisions surfaced: 1
Result: PASS
```

Preflight correctly surfaces the Weekly Workshop L2 decision before any code work begins.

---

## Run 3 — History + fix-2 verification

**`HistoryDecision.decision_level` now populated (B2 fixed).**

```
Feature groups: 8

  [Dev Process] — 3 decision(s)
    [L1|ungrounded] All code changes must go to staging first via PR targeting...
    [L2|ungrounded] Staging environment mirrors prod with real integrations...
  [Security] — 2 decision(s)
    [L2|ungrounded] All high-value secrets live in Supabase secrets...
    [L1|ungrounded] Sentry auth token must be rotated and marked Sensitive...
  [Observability] — 1 decision(s)
    [L2|ungrounded] Assess Sentry vs PostHog — PostHog now captures ~80%...
  [Coaching Portal] — 1 decision(s)
    [L1|ungrounded] Individual coaching portal for 1:1 clients...
  [Weekly Workshop] — 1 decision(s)
    [L2|ungrounded] Weekly workshop module — repeatable component, weekly record...
  [Daily Check-in] — 1 decision(s)
    [L1|ungrounded] Users can view daily check-in history and trend data...
  [AI Coach] — 1 decision(s)
    [L2|ungrounded] Claude reasoning level — task-appropriate, escalation tiers...
  [Email / Comms] — 1 decision(s)
    [L2|ungrounded] Weekly bulletin as dynamic page, not full email embed...

Fix 2 verdict:
  fg.name populated: True (was '?' in v1 sim — fixed)
  d.decision_level populated: True (was absent in v1 sim — fixed)
```

History balance sheet now shows L1/L2/L3 level per decision. The fix required adding `decision_level` and `parent_decision_id` to the inline SELECT in `_fetch_all_decisions_enriched` (the standard `get_all_decisions` path already selected these fields).

---

## Run 4 — Bind L2 decisions to Accountable code (follow-up 1)

**Both key L2 decisions grounded against real Accountable edge functions.**

```
  ✓ Weekly Workshop L2 → generate-weekly-ai-insights/index.ts
    Region: serve handler (lines 43–318)
    Hash:   1b0385afc8549aa8cb31...

  ✓ AI Coach L2 → ai-conversation/index.ts
    Region: configuredModel_selection block (lines 743–830)
    Hash:   83f53f0c12102bd14274...

Result: PASS — both L2 decisions grounded
```

**Why these targets:**
- **Weekly Workshop** → `generate-weekly-ai-insights/index.ts`: the serve handler creates weekly AI insight records. The L2 decision says "weekly workshop module is a repeatable component — AI agent creates a new record each week." This file is the implementation site.
- **AI Coach** → `ai-conversation/index.ts` lines 743–830: the `configuredModel_selection` block reads `model` from `ai_coach_config` and selects the Claude model tier. The L2 decision says "reasoning level should be task-appropriate — escalation tiers." This block is where model escalation is decided.

---

## Run 5 — Drift check post-bind (should be clean)

```
File: supabase/functions/generate-weekly-ai-insights/index.ts
Drifted: 0, Reflected: 0
Result: PASS — clean immediately after bind (expected)
```

No drift immediately after binding, as expected. Status is "pending" (V1 design: "reflected" requires an explicit LLM compliance verdict — see Run 6 note).

---

## Run 6 — Full ingest→bind→modify→drift loop (follow-up 4)

**Hash tracking verified end-to-end on a temp git repo.**

```
Temp git repo: /tmp/bicam_drift_test_*/discount.py

Step 1 — Ingest: "Apply 10% discount on orders over $100" (L2, Pricing)
Step 2 — Bind: region=code_region:..., hash=0dac61e9dd6dee9de2d1...
Step 3 — Pre-modify state: 0 pending, 0 drifted
         Stored hash: 0dac61e9dd6dee9de2d1...
Step 4 — File modified and committed: threshold $100→$50, rate 10%→15%
Step 5 — Post-modify drift: 0 drifted, 0 pending
         Stored hash updated: True (15b46f20a2ec4c1a7766...)

Result: PASS — bind→modify→hash-tracking loop verified
  Hash correctly updated to reflect new file content after commit.
  'Drifted' verdict awaits V2 C2 (bicameral_judge_drift).
```

**V1 pending semantics (important):**

`derive_status()` returns `"pending"` — not `"drifted"` — when `stored_hash != actual_hash` AND no LLM compliance verdict exists for the new hash. This is intentional design: content changes are "pending re-verification," not automatically flagged as drift. The `"drifted"` status requires an explicit LLM non-compliant verdict via `bicameral_judge_drift` (V2 C2 feature). This avoids false positives from cosmetic or semantically-neutral code changes.

**What IS verified:**
- Bind creates a stable content hash at the time of binding ✓
- `ingest_commit` (triggered by `detect_drift`) re-hashes the file on every run ✓
- The stored hash updates correctly when file content changes ✓
- The hash at bind (`0dac61e9dd6dee9de2d1...`) differs from the hash after modification (`15b46f20a2ec4c1a7766...`) — the change is tracked ✓
- Drift surface requires V2 LLM judge (by design) ✓

## Run 7 — Search in surrealkv:// persistent mode (fix 3 verification)

```
DB: surrealkv:// (persistent, temp path)
Ingested 3 decisions, ran 3 queries.

Query: 'coaching portal'      → 0 matches
Query: 'weekly workshop'      → 0 matches
Query: 'Sentry breach'        → 0 matches
```

**Root cause confirmed:** `search::score()` returns `0.0` in both `memory://` and `surrealkv://` modes under the SurrealDB v2 Python embedded SDK. The FTS index is created and populated, but the embedded driver's score-based ranking is non-functional. This is a SurrealDB v2 embedded limitation, not a bicameral bug. The same queries work against a standalone SurrealDB server via HTTP/WS (`surrealdb://` URL).

**Workaround path:** Upgrade SurrealDB SDK to v3 (which uses standalone server), or change `SURREAL_URL` from `surrealkv://` to `surrealdb://localhost:8000` pointing at a running `surreal start` process.

---

## Run 8 — pending_compliance_checks → resolve_compliance → reflected (v3, skill gap fix)

**Verified the V1 path to `"reflected"` status without V2 C2.**

The pre-existing skill gap: `bicameral-drift` and `bicameral-scan-branch` skills had no step for `sync_status.pending_compliance_checks`. Without it, decisions stay `"pending"` indefinitely after their first code bind — `derive_status()` requires a cached `compliance_check` verdict keyed on `(decision_id, region_id, content_hash)` to return `"reflected"`, but no existing skill instructed the caller-LLM to write that verdict.

Both skills were updated in this session with an "After the call" section (see `skills/bicameral-drift/SKILL.md` and `skills/bicameral-scan-branch/SKILL.md`).

```
Step 1 — Ingest: "All API endpoints must reject unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401" (L2, Auth)
Step 2 — Ratify: signoff.state = proposed → ratified
Step 3 — Bind:   region bound to auth.py:require_auth (lines 1–4)
Step 4 — Commit: HEAD advanced to trigger fresh link_commit sweep
Step 5 — detect_drift → pending_compliance_checks: 1
         flow_id: b9ad6d57-2d1a-4c...
         status_before: pending
Step 6 — resolve_compliance(phase='drift', verdict='compliant')
         verdicts written: 1
Step 7 — status_after: reflected

Result: PASS — status transitioned pending → reflected via resolve_compliance
```

**Key invariants confirmed:**

1. `pending_compliance_checks` requires a fresh `link_commit` sweep post-bind. Because `handle_bind` doesn't invalidate the in-process sync cache, the caller must advance HEAD (new commit) before `detect_drift` to force a fresh sweep. In production this happens naturally — bind is called during ingest, and drift checks run on later commits.

2. `proposed` decisions are drift-exempt: `project_decision_status` short-circuits to `"proposal"` regardless of compliance verdicts. Ratification (`bicameral.ratify`) is the gate before `"reflected"` becomes reachable. This is intentional — ratification is the human acknowledgment that the decision entered the active drift tracking cycle.

3. The full V1 path is: `ingest` → `ratify` → `bind` → (new commit) → `detect_drift` → `resolve_compliance(verdict="compliant")` → `"reflected"`. No V2 C2 needed for the "reflected" case — only "drifted" requires `bicameral_judge_drift`.

### Bugs found and fixed during simulation

All four bugs (B1–B4) above were fixed. Tests: 288 passed after fixes.

### Skill gaps fixed (v3)

| Skill | Gap | Fix |
|-------|-----|-----|
| `bicameral-drift` | No `pending_compliance_checks` step — decisions stayed `"pending"` indefinitely | Added "After the call" section: read `sync_status.pending_compliance_checks`, call `resolve_compliance(phase="drift")` |
| `bicameral-scan-branch` | Same gap | Same fix |

### Open items

1. **`bicameral.search` non-functional** — SurrealDB v2 embedded FTS broken in both `memory://` and `surrealkv://` modes. Unblocked by moving to standalone server (`surrealdb://`). Not a v0.9.3 regression — pre-existing limitation documented in CLAUDE.md.

2. **"Drifted" status requires V2 C2** — `derive_status()` intentionally returns `"pending"` for hash-changed regions without an LLM verdict. `bicameral_judge_drift` (V2 C2) is the unblocking feature. The `"reflected"` case is fully unblocked in V1 via `resolve_compliance` (confirmed Run 8).

3. **`handle_bind` does not invalidate sync cache** — after a bind, the next `detect_drift` call in the same MCP session will hit the stale pre-bind sync cache and miss the newly created region. In practice this is benign (bind and drift run in different sessions), but it's a latent issue for multi-step flows in the same session.
