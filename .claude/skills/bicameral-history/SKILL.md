# Bicameral History

Returns a read-only snapshot of everything in the decision ledger, grouped
by feature area, in a shape the dashboard and `/decisions` page can consume
directly.

## When to fire

- *"show the decision history"*
- *"list all decisions"*
- *"what's in the ledger"*
- *"show me everything tracked"*
- *"give me the full decision list"*
- *"what decisions have been recorded"*

## When NOT to fire

- Implementation verbs ("add", "build", "implement") → use `bicameral-preflight`
- Ingest / transcript phrasing → use `bicameral-ingest`
- Drift or drift-by-file questions → out of wedge

## Tool call

```
bicameral.history(
  feature_filter="<optional substring>",   # narrow to one feature
  include_superseded=True,                 # default: include superseded
  as_of="<git-ref>",                       # default: HEAD
)
```

The response also carries an optional `sync_metrics` (`{sync_catchup_ms, barrier_held_ms}`) observability field for the catch-up time spent inside `ensure_ledger_synced`. **Skip rendering it** — these are server-side latency numbers, not user-visible signal. Log them if you're profiling, otherwise ignore.

## How to present

Group decisions by `HistoryFeature`. For each group:

1. **Header**: `FEATURE NAME  Nreflected  Ndrifted  Nungrounded  Nsuperseded`
   - Lead with features that have drifted or ungrounded decisions.
2. **Decisions in the group** — one row per decision:
   - `✓` = reflected, `⚠` = drifted, `○` = ungrounded, `~` = discovered, `—` = superseded
   - Include `sources`, `fulfillment.file_path:start_line`, and `drift_evidence` when present.

When `truncated=True`, note "Showing 50 of N features — use `feature_filter` to drill in."

## Status badges

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| reflected | ✓ | Code matches the recorded decision |
| drifted | ⚠ | Code diverged from the recorded decision |
| ungrounded | ○ | Decision tracked but no code region found |
| discovered | ~ | Code implies a decision that was never recorded |
| superseded | — | Replaced by a later decision |
